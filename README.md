# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction Project
This repository contains code and resources for a project that predicts the possibility of heart disease using machine learning.

Project Goal:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can analyze patient data and predict their risk of developing heart disease.

Data:

The project may utilize various heart disease datasets publicly available online. The specific dataset used will be documented within the code.

Machine Learning Model:

The project will explore Logistic Regression machine learning model for prediction.


Project Structure:

data: This folder may contain the downloaded heart disease dataset in its original format (e.g., CSV).
src: This folder will likely contain the core Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
notebooks: This folder (optional) can include Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model visualization, and experimentation.
requirements.txt: This file lists the Python libraries and dependencies required for the project.
README.md: This file (you are reading it now!) provides an overview of the project.

Getting Started:

Clone the repository: Use git clone https://<github_url> to clone this repository to your local machine.
Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required libraries.
Run the project: Refer to the specific instructions within the src folder or Jupyter Notebooks for executing the code and generating predictions.


Future Enhancements:

Implement a user interface for easier interaction with the prediction model.
Integrate the model into a web application for broader accessibility.
Explore more advanced machine learning models or techniques for improved prediction accuracy.
